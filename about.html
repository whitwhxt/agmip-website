                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>The overall goals envisaged for CalLMIP are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To quantify the reduction in spread across global-scale land models as a result of parameter calibration for a wide range of variables (e.g., carbon and water stores and fluxes, aboveground biomass, soilC etc).</li>
                    <li>To encourage the use of uncertainty quantification methods for constraining parameter uncertainty in global land models.</li>
                    <li>To better understand and exchange knowledge on the variety of methods being used in global land model parameter calibration in order to identify best practices.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Scope</h2>
                <p>This initiative is targeted at global-scale land models - i.e., land surface, terrestrial biosphere models or dynamic global vegetation models that form part of earth system models, or intermediate complexity models and vegetation demographic models that are routinely run at global scale (for example for the global carbon budget).</p>
                
                <h2>Current Status</h2>
                <p>In early 2025 the CalLMIP Steering Committee (see below) initiated the 1st Phase of CalLMIP, with the goal of evaluating how well models' existing ("in-house") parameter calibration efforts reduce model-data misfit and the spread across models for key variables. In March and April 2025 we held a series of three 1st phase planning and development workshops across two time zones to get feedback from the community on the goals and protocol for the 1st Phase, as well as discussing potential future phases of CalLMIP.</p>
                
                <p>The 1st Phase of CalLMIP will officially be launched on November 24th 2025!

                            <p>Dr Nina Raoult is a research scientist at ECMWF, specialising in land surface modelling, parameter estimation, and machine learning. She currently contributes to the Destination Earth initiative, where she works on developing a data-driven Earth system model with a focus on the land component. She previously held an ESA CCI fellowship at LSCE in France and a Marie Curie fellowship at the University of Exeter, working with a range of observational datasets and data assimilation methods to reduce parametric uncertainty in a number of land surface models. Although awarded a Royal Society fellowship in 2024, she chose instead to join ECMWF where she contributes to the anemoi framework and expands the machine-learning toolkit for land surface modelling. In addition to serving on the CalLMIP organising committee, Nina is a member of the ML4LM (Machine Learning for Land Modelling) organising committee, co-organised the International Land Modeling Forum's webinar on parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification, and led a key community paper on machine-learning approaches for parameter estimation in land surface modelling.</p>
